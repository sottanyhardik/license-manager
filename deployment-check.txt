DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT ANALYSIS - auto-deploy.sh
===========================================

STATUS: ✅ WORKING - Ready to use

Configuration:
- Branch: version-4.1 ✅ (Correct)
- Servers: 143.110.252.201, 139.59.92.226
- User: django
- Path: /home/django/license-manager

What it does:
1. Pulls latest code from version-4.1
2. Builds frontend (npm install + build)
3. Installs Python dependencies
4. Runs database migrations (with auto-fix for permissions)
5. Collects static files
6. Restarts all services (gunicorn, celery, nginx)
7. Tests API endpoints
8. Verifies Celery tasks

Potential Issues:
⚠️  Password hardcoded in script (security concern)
⚠️  Purges ALL Celery tasks (might lose queued work)
⚠️  Different DB names per server (verify this is correct)

How to use:
1. Run verification: ./verify-deployment.sh
2. If checks pass: ./auto-deploy.sh

Expected time: 10-20 minutes (both servers)

The script is ready to use and should work fine for you.
